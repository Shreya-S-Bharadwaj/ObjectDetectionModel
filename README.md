# Object Detection Model

Implemented an Object Dettection Model based on the SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) paper published in 2016. The paper mentions different datasets that have been used for training the SSD model like PASCAL VOC, COCO and ILSVRC.

In this project my team used the PASCAL VOC dataset for our SSD model. It is trained to identify 21 different categories such as - 'aeroplane','bicycle', 'bird', 'boat', 'bottle','bus', 'car', 'cat','chair','cow','diningtable','dog','horse','motorbike','person','pottedplant','sheep','sofa','train','tvmonitor' and 'background'.

Here are a few snapshots of the model output -
